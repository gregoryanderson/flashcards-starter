# FlashCards

Flashcards is a game that we can play in the terminal. It takes a dataset, compiles it, and finally, displays it for the user so they may quiz themselves on the dataset. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to take a deep dive into TDD, or test driven development. To do this, there are five files- Card, Deck, Turn, Round, Game, that all must be tested in their respective test files. We also used Mocha, a testing library, and Chai, an assertion library. 

## Setup

To play the game, open the terminal and enter the appropriate filepath. Then, enter `node index.js`. This will prompt a message and the first question. Choose the correct answers and get an fun response; Choose an incorrect answer and get a not-so-fun response. Good luck!
